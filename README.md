This repository habours a website for our photography and videography services business. It is a multi-page site with a modern and quite unique design as opposed to the generalized look of photography portfolio websites. 
It also has a number of intuitive features that gets the user/client to experience a responsive but informative interface.The user gets to interact with a number of CTAs, Galleries, blog posts etc.
I built it from the ground up using html, css and javascript. Then deployed a few libraries to further enhance the user experience.
